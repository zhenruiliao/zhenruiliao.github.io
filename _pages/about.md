Systems neuroscientist working at the intersection of learning, theory, and disease, with a background in Electrical engineering and 8+ years of experience in two-photon calcium imaging, mathematical modeling, and machine learning. I am interested in how abstractions and sequences are learned and represented in the brain, and how these representations form the building blocks of episodic memory (autobiographical "stories"). My long-term career aim is to develop and experimentally test quantitative theories of how high-level computation emerges from local cell and microcircuit dynamics, and how perturbations of the latter lead to deficits in cognition.
