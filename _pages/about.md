I am an MD-PhD candidate in Neuroscience at Columbia University in the second year of my PhD. Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of learning, theory, and disease. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and two-photon calcium imaging, I study the biological algorithms underlying the learning of the statistical structure of the world in the mammalian hippocampus, as well as the circuits that implement them. I compare these algorithms to those used to solve identical tasks in machine learning. Finally, I investigate what happens when these biological algorithms go awry in "diseases of computation", such as temporal lobe epilepsy. One of my long-term career goals is to develop mathematical theories of disease in order to gain a computational and mechanistic understanding of pathological processes, and thereby identify potential novel targets for treatment.
