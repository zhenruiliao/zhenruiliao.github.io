Systems neuroscientist working at the intersection of learning, theory, and disease, with a background in Electrical engineering and 8+ years of experience in two-photon calcium imaging, mathematical modeling, and machine learning. I received my BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2017 and my PhD in Neuroscience from Columbia in 2022. I am interested in how abstractions and sequences are learned and represented in the brain, and how these representations form the building blocks of episodic memory (autobiographical "stories"). My long-term career aim is to develop and experimentally test quantitative theories of how high-level computation emerges from local cell and microcircuit dynamics, and how perturbations of the latter lead to deficits in cognition. My latest project involves using virtual reality to teach mice group theory.
