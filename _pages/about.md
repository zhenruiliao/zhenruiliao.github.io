Electrical engineer turned systems neuroscientist working at the intersection of learning, theory, and disease, with 8+ years of experience in two-photon calcium imaging, mathematical modeling, and machine learning. I am interested in how abstractions and sequences are learned and represented in the brain, and how these representations form the building blocks of experience. My long-term career aim is to develop and experimentally test quantitative theories of how high-level computation emerges from local cell and microcircuit dynamics, and how perturbations of the latter lead to deficits in cognition. My latest project involves using virtual reality to teach mice group theory.
