Systems neuroscientist working at the intersection of learning, theory, and disease, with a background in Electrical engineering and 10+ years of experience in two-photon calcium imaging, mathematical modeling, and machine learning. I am interested in how abstractions and sequences are learned and represented in the brain, and how these representations form the building blocks of episodic memory (autobiographical "stories"). My long-term career aim is to develop and experimentally test quantitative theories of how high-level computation emerges from local cell and microcircuit dynamics, and how perturbations of the latter lead to deficits in cognition. 

In 2025, I was recognized as an [_Outstanding Scholar in Neuroscience_](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/scientific-director/office-of-fellowship-and-training/outstanding-scholars-in-neuroscience-award-program/current-previous-recipients-of-the-nih-outstanding-scholars-in-neuroscience-award-osnap) by the National Institutes of Health.
